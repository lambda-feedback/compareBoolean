title: Trivial comparisons
tests:
  - description: The response and answer are exactly the same, so the response should be considered correct.
    # Parameters can be given, but this field can be removed if none are needed
    params: {}
    answer: "A & B"
    response: "A & B"
    expected_result:
      is_correct: yes
      # Ensure that the latex returned (for the preview) is correct

  - description: Multi-character variable names are also supported
    answer: "A & Test"
    response: "A & Test"

title: Trivial comparisons, but not identical
tests:
  - description: Variables can appear in any order.
    answer: "A & B"
    response: "B & A"
    expected_result:
      is_correct: yes
      # Any other fields returned by the evaluation function can be tested too, but this is optional.

  - description: > # Multi-line strings are possible for readability
      The wrong operator is used, so this is incorrect as
      the two expressions have different truth tables.
    answer: "A & B"
    response: "A | B"
    expected_result:
      is_correct: no

# This illustrates how sub-tests can be used to share the same answer and parameters
# for multiple tests.
title: More complex comparisons
tests:
  - description: XOR can be implemented using NAND or NOR
    answer: "A ^ B"
    sub_tests:
      - description: "Using NAND:"
        response: "~(~(A & ~(A & B)) & ~(B & ~(A & B)))"
        expected_result:
          is_correct: yes
      - description: "Using NOR:"
        response: "~(~(~A | ~B) | ~(A | B))"
